# Online book on Quantum Computing for beginners

This book is sort of overview of **Quantum Computing** for beginners. It will take you through the basic concepts of *Quantum Mechanics* and *Quantum Computing*.

I am not an expert but I will try my best to give a clear picture. But only theory cannot teach these things. So, we will also use Qiskit to see simulations. Because of this I will ask you guys to learn a bit of python.

If you have taken a course on basic Quantum Mecxhanics then It will be great. But It should be fine even if you guys don't had any course before.

After following this course you will:
- Have a rough idea on basic Quantum Mechanics.
- Get a overview of what is Quantum Computing.
- Learn to implement basic quantum circuits on qiskit and run those on real Quantum Devices.

Go right to the [introduction](Chapters/Chapter_1/Intro_0) for in-depth information about things the book will cover.
